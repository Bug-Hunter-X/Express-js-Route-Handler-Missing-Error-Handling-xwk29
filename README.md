## Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route fails to handle cases where `:id` is not a valid numeric user ID.

**bug.js** shows the erroneous code.  **bugSolution.js** provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

This issue can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.  Robust error handling is crucial for building reliable applications.
